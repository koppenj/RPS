Rock Paper Scissors JS project


Attempting to create my rendition fo the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using JS.

Update 7/31/21:
    I've implemented a UI using DOM manipulation in JavaScript by following TOP project guidelines. 
    I hope to make it pretty/even more funcitonal in the future when I have some downtime. Would love to get it into Creations-Showcase!
